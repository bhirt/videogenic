# Two Basic Examples

These animated gifs give a basic idea of what the interface looks like.   These gifs are running at 2fps and scaled to 512px to limit the bandwith of the images.  The actual interface is much much more responsive.

## Cutting Video

This demonstrates changing the ranges on an edit decision, adding and removing edit decisions and selecting how to select a frame for you start/end point.

You also see additional information about the EDL, splice points in the final video and various lengths of the video before and after cut.

## Split Video

This demonstrates how to select a point for a video to be split.  You can see if there is an EDL for the video, the commercials will be displayed in red and you also get an idea of how long it takes to split a 1.8G file into two parts.  The video is not sped up and is the actual time it takes to split the files on my late 2012 iMac.
